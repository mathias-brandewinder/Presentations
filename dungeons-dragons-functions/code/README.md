# Code Samples

The Fable-Elmish example is directly using the [Fable Elmish minimal sample](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/9f73c4ddf47cc31fe24ab3c554c487a29a9150bb), with almost no modification. Check the README.md file in the fable-elmish folder for setup information.

The complete project can be found in the [MonsterVault](https://github.com/mathias-brandewinder/monstervault) repository. This is **work in progress**: there is probably some good, some bad and some ugly. You have been warned.
